                <p class="b">I’m a human-loving introvert based in a cold, northern country in my hometown Trondheim. </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    I have a bachelor degree in Graphic Design from Kristiania University College, majoring in web- and universal design from my bachelor’s thesis. After first semester when I was introduced to interaction design subject and the coding languages like HTML & CSS for building websites, it led me after graduation into the Front -end Development program at Noroff Vocational school of technology and digital media where I further worked toward 
                    my UX/UI path and dream. As a designer, I like to keep it clean and simple, where my goals in every project is to focus on transparent content and clear visual communication that works across different devices and media. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always wanted to work in a creative field that involves design that could possibly make the digital world a better and more beautiful place to live in.

                    As a designer, I like to keep it clean and simple, where my goals in every project is to focus on transparent content and clear visual communication that works across different devices and media. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always wanted to work in a creative field that involves design that could possibly make the digital world a better and more beautiful place to live in. My strengths are bringing ideas and concepts to the table, putting myself in the user’s shoes and solving issues that at first seem impossible. Persistence, open-mind and an obsessive attention to detail defines me.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Outside of work, you can find me getting fresh air with my dog and my SLR camera, well-planted in my office-chair with some casual gaming, or letting my imagination flow through painting brush or pencil. Feel free to connect, whether you are just looking to chat, talk about design, or have an opportunity opening!
